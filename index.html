          <h1> Bunker </h1>
          <p> Many bunkers and shelters throughout Italy were built to provide shelter during the Second World War. Among the best known are those of Villa Torlonia (in the photo), today a public park but once the Roman residence of Benito Mussolini. The works for their construction began in 1942 , with the aim of allowing Mussolini and his family to escape the bombing of the Allies. Cylindrical structure, they are located six meters underground and are protected by 4 meters of reinforced concrete. They were never used by Mussolini, who was arrested on 25 April 1943. Today they are open to the public for guided tours. </p>

          <h1> Small Mountain </h1>
          <p> A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers. </p>

          <h1> Walking On a Dream </h1>
          <p> A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. Humans spend about two hours dreaming per night, and each dream lasts around 5 to 20 minutes.The content and function of dreams have been topics of scientific, philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history. Dream interpretation, practiced by the Babylonians in the third millennium BCE and even earlier by the ancient Sumerians, figures prominently in religious texts in several traditions, and has played a lead role in psychotherapy. The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology. Most modern dream study focuses on the neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing hypotheses regarding dream function. It is not known where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple regions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind. </p>
